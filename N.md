`draft` `optional` `author:arejula27` 

This NIP defines new event kinds for encrypted messages. It work in the same way as NIP-04,but the structure 
of the content is different.


**`content`** MUST be equal to the base64-encoded, aes-256-cbc encrypted string of anything a user wants to write, encrypted using a shared cipher 
generated by combining the recipient's public-key with the sender's private-key; this appended by the base64-encoded initialization vector as if it
was a querystring parameter named "iv". The format is the following: `"content": "<encrypted_text>?iv=<initialization_vector>"`. The encripted text 
has the following format: `{subject:<subject>, content:<content>}`

**`tags`** MUST contain an entry identifying the receiver of the message (such that relays may naturally forward this event to them), in the form `["p", "<pubkey, as a hex string>"]`.

**`tags`** MAY contain a entry indetifying the prevoious mail which is repliying in the form  `["e", "<event_id>"]`.


A mail can be replied by other mail which MUST have a tag
  
## Mark a mail as read
